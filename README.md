# Final_Project_Malware_Analysis

# Authors: Edwin Cervantes and XXXXXXXXXX

# Summary of Project:
  For our final project we have chosen to create a disassembler with the purpose of disassembling Python code. This project was decided after being given a recommendation from Professor Hawkins and his examples of disassemblers he had made. Our product will be a command line based tool following the syntax of:
  python3 disassembler.py -d test.py (using the -d option for disassembler tool 1)
  python3 disassembler.py -t test.py (using the -t option for disassembler tool 2)
 disassembler.py is our tool, while the test.py is the file we want to disassemble.

# Deliverables
  Our Deliverables will include .zip folder. Within that .zip we will include the working product, instructions on how to utilize that product, an example Python script to test the product on, and a write up on our overall thoughts of the product we had created. This write-up will contain things such as how we collaborated on the product as a team, on difficulties we had on the project, what we would have liked to do if given more time, and what we think of our achievements.
